Identify the first improvements based on the task list in `docs/plan.md` and plan on completing the task.
Use the following workflow. Execute each in order:
 * Address the task in the plan by updating and creating code.
 * Create tests for the changes you made.
 * Run the relevant code to ensure it works as expected
 * run the application without any arguments and correct any errors and warnings you find iteratively until no errors or warnings are found..
 * run the application with the "compat" argument and correct any errors and warnings you find iteratively until it works without error.
 * Update the documentation if needed.
 * commit and push all files - craft a good commit message relevant to the task you are completing.
 * After completing each task, mark it as done by changing the checkbox from [ ] to [X]
