Iteratively implement the improvements based on the task list in `docs/plan.md` one by one starting from the top one that is not checked.
After completing each task, mark it as done by changing the checkbox from [ ] to [x].
Make sure to not develop overlapping features if the plan.md repeats itself.
Remove overlapping features from plan.md.
For each task, use the following workflow - execute each in order and show the result:
 * make sure all files are committed and git status is clear
 * work on the task to completion
 * create tests for the task
 * run the relevant code to ensure it works as expected
 * run the application without any arguments and correct any errors and warnings you find iteratively until it works without error. Also, ensure running the test suite returns without errors or warnings.
 * run the application with the "run" argument and correct any errors and warnings you find iteratively until it works without error.
 * commit and push all files
Only implement the first on the list and stop.
