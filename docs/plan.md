Tasks:

- [x] Create a means to generate command line completion scripts for all major shells and operating systems (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)
- [x] Update the README to include all the above including the means to install, configure and run
- [x] create documentation for the project that can be pushed to github pages using a github action
- [x] create a github action to publish the documentation to github pages
- [ ] Update the README to include a section on how to convert from pre-commit to rustyhook
- [ ] create a command line tool that can be used to convert a pre-commit configuration file to rustyhook configuration file
- [ ] expand all built in hooks to include all known hooks from https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html
- [ ] enable logging to a file or other outputs other than just stdout
- [ ] ensure logging levels are configurable and appropriate for all execution steps
- [ ] enable using rustyhook in this repository as for pre-commit replacement and configure for a rust project
- [ ] replace the use of pip with uv - potentially link to the source code so as to get the benefit without needing a local binary
- [ ] emulate all known pre-commit hooks for use with native execution - all known hooks at https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
- [ ] create tests for each hook and complete coverage
- [ ] replace the npm and nvm install process with fnm if it makes sense to do so
- [ ] Remove the duplicate code in the github actions by consolidating the build steps and deployment steps into a single workflow
- [ ] Re-evaluate the use of python and other languages in the docker file as they are likely not needed
- [ ] Update the `.junie/guidelines.md` file to include the new features and rust best practices
- [ ] Use a mechanism to create and deploy semver compatible releases. Perhaps use cargo-release or some other mechanism to automatically generate release notes and create a tag - trigger a release on tag creation.
- [ ] Remove the dependency on a base interpreter for python, node and ruby by downloading the required interpreters from the internet and installing locally. Make sure to abide by the correct versions in the .python-version and similar files. As this is for a monorepo you will need to ensure the use per sub-directory.
- [ ] Take the best ideas from the pre-commit and lefthook projects and integrate them into rustyhook.
- [ ] ensure all tasks can operate in parallel
- [ ] implement an "explain" command that can be used to explain the current configuration and any errors that may have occurred.
- [ ] use uv to start all python hooks in a separate process
- [ ] use fnm to start all node hooks in a separate process
- [ ] Add a strict rust linter to the project
